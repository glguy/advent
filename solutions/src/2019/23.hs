This problem builds a packet network out of 50 concurrently executing
intcode machines. It's implemented by keeping track of the individual
machines, a packet delivery queue, and the most recent NAT packet.
As the system is simulated a list of interesting simulation events is
produced that can be processed to compute the answers to both parts of
the problem.
