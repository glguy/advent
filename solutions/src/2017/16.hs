Day 16 defines a language of renaming and permutations and asks us
to iterate the program one billion times!

The key to this solution is that 'stimes' can used repeated squaring
to efficiently compute the result of multiplication by a large factor.

There are two kind of dance moves: permutation of positions, and renamings
of dancers. These two kinds of moves commute with each other. Both renamings
and permutations can efficiently compose, so we represent a dance as a single
renaming and a single permutation. This representation means that our dance
combination operation ('<>') is associative, as required for dances to be a
'Monoid' because the component permutations themselves support an associative
composition.
