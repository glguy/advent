This automata implementation uses a few optimizations:

It precomputes the neighborhood map that can be quickly
translated to any position without recomputing the map.
Unioning one of these for each live cell gives us a Map
where each element tells us how many neighbors that
cell has. Taking the union of these maps is faster than
inserting individual neighbor elements.

This solution only needs to consider elements that have
any neighbors at all, and these values are determined
by only considering the live elements from the previous
generation.

The solution avoids checking if a particular cell in the
previous generation was alive or not unless it's neighbors
is known to be @2@, as this is the only time it matters.

This solution works both with a flexible, n-dimensional
list coordinate representation and also with more
efficient unpacked tuples of integers. The list version
is about 2x slower than the unpacked tuples.

On my MacBook Pro, part 2 of this problem runs in 50ms.
